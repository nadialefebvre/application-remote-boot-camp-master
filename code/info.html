      <h1>Stack Overflow in a nutshell</h1>
      <p>Stack Overflow can be seen like a hybrid: it mixes some features of two community platforms, i.e. it's a
        knowledge database like
        <a class="reference" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow"
          title="Wikipedia page about Stack Overflow" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>
        with comments and votes on Q&amp;A like
        <a class="reference" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stackoverflow/" title="Reddit section on Stack Overflow"
          target="_blank">Reddit</a>
        and it is specifically aimed at programmers.
      </p>
      <p>The process is quite simple:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Person A posts a question.</li>
        <li>Person B (and C, D, etc.) answers the question.</li>
        <li>Person A accepts one of the answers as the right one.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>And in all this process, people can comment on answers, edit the posts and vote them up or down
        (some actions are privileges obtained through reputation).
      </p>
      <p>A beginner may participate on Stack Overflow as much as a senior programmer, but obviously the former posts
        more to ask than to answer, while it's the contrary for the latter. There are numerous testimonies on the Web
        about professionals annoyed by beginners' questions, but if a new learner does some prior research to show that
        they tried to find a solution and formulates a complete and clear question, the experience on Stack Overflow
        will be very helpful. The
        <a class="reference" href="https://stackoverflow.com/help" title="Stack Overflow's help center"

        offers guidance about the good practices of asking and answering. Jon Skeet, a famous Stack Overflow
        contributor, identified in a
